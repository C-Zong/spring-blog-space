### What I did (10/18)

- Worked on the HTML header

### Thoughts (10/18)

- Progress was a bit slow. I had planned to finish the front end, but I ended up taking the whole break to relax. Hopefully, I can finish the project after winter break &#x1F642;

```PowerShell

```PowerShell
npx create-next-app@latest . --ts
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/pm @tiptap/starter-kit
```

- Learning Next.js is easier for fast content delivery and Search Engine Optimization. Its server-side rendering pre-renders pages, so search engines can see the content right away. I'm switching from Vite to Next.js.
- Current Frontend Stack:

```Tech Stack
Framework: React + TypeScript

UI / Styling: TailwindCSS

Build Tool: Next.js

State Management: Redux Toolkit (for user login state, shopping cart, and analytics data)

Rich Text Editor: TipTap (for users to write blog posts)
```

### What I did (09/28)

- Installed Node.js → ran `npm create vite@latest .` → React + TypeScript + React Compiler
- Tried setting up **Tailwind CSS** (ran into issues)

### Problems I hit (09/28)

- Messed around uninstalling Node.js from D drive and reinstalling on C drive
- Downloaded `tailwindcss-windows-x64.exe` (turns out that was useless)
- Learned that `npx tailwindcss init -p` is outdated

### Thoughts (09/28)

- I really hate environment setup — most of the time I don’t know what the commands actually do, so I just *pray* the instructions are correct
- Lesson learned: next time I’ll check the official docs first
